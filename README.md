## 💡 What I've been working on

Here are some highlights of my recent technical impact:

- **Mobile Architecture Leadership:** Led the end-to-end development of an enterprise **iPad application** (React Native), integrating native Objective-C modules for seamless device-to-device communication.
- **Frontend Strategy:** Spearheaded the migration and modernization of core web platforms, defining the strategy for **React/Redux** implementations and ensuring pixel-perfect delivery.
- **Backend Scalability:** Designed and deployed **Node.js microservices** on AWS (Lambda, ECS), optimizing authentication flows (Cognito) and handling high-concurrency workloads.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Automated complex deployment pipelines using **Terraform** and **GitHub Actions**, reducing deployment times and eliminating manual errors.
- **Mentorship & R&D:** actively guiding Junior/Mid developers through code reviews and leading R&D initiatives to adopt modern tools like **Next.js** and **Serverless** patterns.
